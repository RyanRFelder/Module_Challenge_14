 Algorithmic Trading Bots: Machine Learning Investment Strategy Results Comparison

This program includes a test set of machine learning algorithms driven by the sklearn library (SVC model and DecisionTreeClassifier used here). The ML classifiers were run on the same data set, using data of the same time period. 


Evaluation Report:

In comparing the results of the machine learning efficacy in algorithmic trading for the SVC classifier and the decision tree classifier, the charts below, displaying the strategy v. actual returns of each model, indicate that the SVC classifier's cumulative returns underperform the predictive modeling of the decision tree classifier. For the dataset used in these tests (OHLVC.csv) the DecisionTreeClassifier model proved to be more effective in algorithmic trading performance.
